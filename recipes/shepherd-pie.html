        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
              Place potatoes in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
              Turn the heat to medium-low, and boil potatoes until tender, about 25 minutes; drain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stir vegan mayonnaise, soy milk, olive oil, vegan cream cheese, and salt into potatoes, 
              and mash with a potato masher until smooth and fluffy. Set mashed potatoes aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), and spray a 2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir onion, carrots, celery, frozen peas, and tomato until softened, about 10 minutes. 
              Stir in Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduce the heat to medium-low, and crumble vegetarian ground beef substitute into the skillet with vegetables. 
              Cook and stir, breaking up the meat substitute, until the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Spread vegetarian meat substitute mixture into the bottom of the baking dish, and top with prepared mashed potatoes, smoothing them into an even layer. 
              Sprinkle potatoes with shredded soy cheese.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and slightly browned and the casserole is hot, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
